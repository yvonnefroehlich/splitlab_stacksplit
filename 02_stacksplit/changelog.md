## Release [v3.0](https://github.com/michaelgrund/stacksplit/releases/tag/v3.0) (2021-12-23) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5802051.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5802051)

* Adjusted and updated several StackSplit functions to work on newer MATLAB versions (>=2020a)
* Removed or replaced deprecated built-in MATLAB functions
* Fixed start time extraction by SplitLab (for details see [**Fröhlich et al., 2022**](https://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/8781) and the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/yvonnefroehlich/SplitLab-TemporalAlignment))
* Added warning message box if non-nulls and nulls are selected together for stacking (which is not really reasonable)
* Added warning message box if current screen resolution does not allow to display StackSplit's main panel properly:
  * Solution for **Windows 10**: under *Settings* => *System* => *Display* => *Scale and Layout* => *Change the size of text, apps, and other items*
  the selection sometimes is set to a value different from 100% (e.g. 150%)
  which effectively reduces your screen size in pixels. Set it to 125% or
  better 100% and check again, mostly then the panel fits on the screen.

## Release [v2.0](https://github.com/michaelgrund/stacksplit/releases/tag/v2.0) (2019-06-28) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7118716.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7118716)

* Adjusted several functions to work also on MATLAB 2018a and b
* Now results are additionally saved in a text-file which can be used directly in GMT (Generic Mapping Tools)
